/**
 * `initOpenBoxInstrumentation(options)` — Tier A1 composition root.
 *
 * Installs the fetch + node:http + node:https + fs.promises + fs.sync
 * governance patches and activates `traced()` for ONE bound `OpenBoxRuntime`,
 * per the Phase 4 per-runtime invariant applied to this phase's process-global
 * patch surface: fetch is a process global and `node:http`/`node:https`,
 * `fs.promises`, and the sync `node:fs` methods are all single shared module
 * objects, so at most one runtime can govern them at a time. fetch and
 * node:http/https are preflight-BLOCKING (a BLOCK verdict stops the request
 * before it is sent); `fs.promises` is preflight-enforced; sync fs is
 * completed-hook telemetry only (a sync Node API cannot await the async runtime
 * before the op runs — see `file-io-sync-wrapper.ts`). Root-import-free by
 * construction — nothing in this module (or anything it imports) runs at
 * import time; every side effect happens inside `initOpenBoxInstrumentation`
 * itself, and this module is never re-exported from the package root
 * (`src/index.ts`).
 *
 * Also installs Tier A2/B database driver governance (`pg`, `redis`,
 * `mysql2`, `mongodb`) — but ONLY for drivers the caller explicitly names via
 * `options.databases` (resolving plan OQ5 as explicit opt-in, never
 * auto-detected). Unlike fetch/fs, none of the four DB drivers are
 * dependencies of this package at all (each is an OPTIONAL PEER, a
 * devDependency of this repo for tests only) — attempting to `require()` one
 * the caller never asked for would fail-loud/diagnose for a driver the host
 * application may not even have installed, merely because instrumentation
 * happens to be on. `instrumentation.dbEnabled` (default `true`) is the
 * master kill switch for the whole DB tier, the same shape as
 * `httpEnabled`/`fileEnabled`; `options.databases` (default empty — i.e. no
 * driver is ever patched by default) selects WHICH drivers to attempt when
 * that switch is on. Each requested driver is installed/rolled back through
 * the SAME fail-loud `assertPatchable` and atomic-partial-failure handling
 * already used for fetch/fs/function below.
 *
 * Idempotency / concurrency-safety: `initOpenBoxInstrumentation` and
 * `shutdown()` are both fully SYNCHRONOUS (no internal `await`). Because
 * Node's event loop never preempts a running synchronous function, two
 * "concurrent" callers can never actually interleave inside either one —
 * there is no window where fetch/fs.promises sit half-patched. Re-init with
 * the SAME runtime while already active is a true no-op (the existing
 * installation is returned untouched, so no teardown-then-reinstall step
 * — and therefore no ungoverned window — ever happens). Re-init with a
 * DIFFERENT runtime while one is active throws rather than silently swapping
 * governance out from under the first runtime.
 *
 * Fail-loud (Decision 17): each target's patchability is checked before
 * installing. A target that cannot be patched emits a HARD diagnostic
 * (`logger.error`, never `warn`/`info`) and instrumentation proceeds WITHOUT
 * that target rather than silently doing nothing; `options.strict` upgrades
 * that diagnostic to a thrown `OpenBoxInstrumentationError` instead. Tier A1
 * has no per-instance "driver client created before init" failure mode (fetch
 * is a global, fs.promises and sync fs are shared module objects — all patched
 * fresh on every `init()` regardless of when other code imported them); that
 * failure mode is inherent to per-instance prototype patches (`pg.Client`,
 * `mysql.Connection`, ...) and is a Tier A2/B concern. `assertPatchable`
 * below is written generically so those tiers can reuse it unchanged.
